# net.splitcells.network.distro
This is a software distribution of the Splitcells Network project cluster.
It bundles software together, in order to provide a program with all the cluster's features.
## Why does this distro project exist?
This distribution is not located in the main repo,
because the main repo contains only core functionality.
Other things like plugins, software integrations and extensions, documents and media files are optional.
This way the main repo is not dependent on optional software.
